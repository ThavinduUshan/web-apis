# WEB APIs

This application is developed by me to practice the use of web APIs.
Here I have used the WeatherAPI.com to create plaform for users to 
find the details about weather condition in their city and another
platform for users to find sports events that are upcoming.

## Weather Checker

Using this platform users can simply findout the weather condition 
of any given city of their choice. To develop this system I have used the
RealTime Weather API provided by the Weather.com API.

## Sport Events Checker

Using this platform users can simply findout the sport evenets that 
are recently happening. To develop this system I have used the
Sports API provided by the Weather.com API.

## Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, Javascript
